Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a passionate Software Developer with 3 years of solid experience, currently in my final year studying Computer Science at Jamhuuriyo University of Science & Technology.

Throughout my journey, Iâ€™ve worked with different organizations and startups, where I contributed to developing various web platforms, management systems, and custom business applications. My roles have allowed me to handle complete development cycles â€” from planning and system design to implementation and delivery â€” always focusing on solving real-world problems through technology.

I collaborate closely with teams to deliver reliable and efficient solutions that drive meaningful impact and meet client goals.

I enjoy bringing creativity into my work, finding smart solutions to challenges, and constantly learning to stay ahead in the fast-moving tech world. Always open to new projects, collaborations, and challenges!
